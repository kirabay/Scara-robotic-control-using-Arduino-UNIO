# Scara-robotic-control-using-Arduino-UNIO
The overall aim of this project is to control SCARA robot using Arduino Uno
microcontroller to pick and place the object in desired position via user defined commands
More specifically this project:
 Control the robot joints by analyzing the kinematics of the robot and applying
control techniques.
 Move the robot accordingly based on the commands given by the user
 Control the speed, acceleration and torque using different control commands.
 Sets a limit for the working space of the SCARA.
 Move objects for a repeatable loop of desired positions
